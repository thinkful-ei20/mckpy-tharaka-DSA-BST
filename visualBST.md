Given the following data
```E A S Y Q U E S T I O N```
a binary search tree will look as follows:
```
            E
          /   \
        A       S
         \     /   \
          E   Q     Y
            /  \     /
           I    S   U
            \      /
             O    T
            / 
           N   
```


Given the following data
```3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7```
a binary search tree will look as follows:
```
          3
      /      \
    1          4
      \          \
        2          6
                  /  \
                 5     9
                  \
                    7
```

If the ROOT gets deleted,
the binary search tree changes like so:
```
        2
    /      \
  1          4
    \         \
      6        9
    /   \
  5       7
```
